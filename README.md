# **Featured User**

This component allows admins to display a banner at the top of the site to feature a user, along with the reason for featuring them. Admins can control what stats of the user to show, and for the duration the banner shows.

There is also an option to add an icon beside the user's username in their user card and posts, with a customizable text on hover.
